## What I'm all about

I'm an engineering student who loves building things that actually work and solve problems. Currently diving deep into AI and full-stack development, with a particular interest in how machine learning can be applied to finance and real-world applications.

When I'm not buried in coursework, you'll find me experimenting with new frameworks, building side projects, or analyzing market trends (yes, I'm one of those people who finds stock charts fascinating).

**What keeps me busy:** Building AI applications, full-stack web development, and exploring fintech solutions

## My toolkit

**Languages I speak (to computers)**
```
Python • C/C++ • JavaScript • SQL
```

**Web stuff**
```
HTML/CSS • Flask • REST APIs • Streamlit • MERN Stack
```

**ML & AI magic**
```
NumPy • Pandas • Scikit-learn • Transformers • Sentence-Transformers
NLP • Sentiment Analysis • Predictive Modeling
```

**What I love building**
```
Full-Stack Applications • AI/ML Solutions • Financial Models • API Systems
```

## Projects I'm proud of

### WebGalaxy - Because who has time to code websites from scratch?
**Jan-Feb 2025**

Ever wanted to just describe a website and have it magically appear? That's exactly what I built. This MERN stack app takes your natural language description and generates a fully responsive website.

The fun part was figuring out how to make the AI understand what you actually want - I used sentence transformers to parse the semantic meaning and match it to design patterns. Plus, it automatically grabs relevant images and generates content, so you get a complete site, not just a template.

**Built with:** React, Node.js, MongoDB, Express, Python, BeautifulSoup, Gemini API

### Nifty 50 Stock Forecasting - When news sentiment meets market predictions
**Feb-Mar 2025**

You know how everyone says "buy the rumor, sell the news"? I wanted to test if that's actually true. So I built a system that analyzes financial news sentiment and correlates it with next-day stock movements.

Turns out, market sentiment is pretty predictive when you process it right. I used FinBERT and VADER to extract sentiment scores and built regression models that significantly outperformed baseline predictions. The best part? Seeing the model correctly predict market reactions to major news events.

**Built with:** Python, FinBERT, VADER, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Financial APIs

### Mini Q&A API System - Google meets GPT, but simpler
**Dec 2024-Jan 2025**

Sometimes you just want quick, accurate answers without scrolling through endless search results. This system takes your question, searches for relevant information, and gives you a concise answer with proper citations.

The challenge was making it fast and accurate - I built an asynchronous pipeline that processes queries in parallel and uses BART for summarization. The frontend is clean and responsive, perfect for quick research sessions.

**Built with:** Flask, BART, Google Search API, HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## What I'm learning

**Computer Science fundamentals:**
- Data Structures and Algorithms (because leetcode is life)
- Theoretical CS and Automata Theory
- Competitive Programming (IICPC Summer Camp)

**Math that actually matters:**
- Linear Algebra and Calculus
- Differential Equations
- Mathematical Economics (surprisingly useful for ML)

## Some wins along the way

- **Smart India Hackathon:** Made it to top 10 out of 300+ teams
- **Inter IIT Bootcamp:** Bronze for a carbon-reduction tech solution
- **Academic stuff:** Top 10% ranking (turns out showing up to class helps)
- **Finance & Economics Club:** Core team member - led analysis on 100+ mutual funds
